##Syntactic Analysis

For this assignment, youâ€™ll use the Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset. The Universal tagset of NLTK comprises only 12 coarse tag classes as follows: Verb, Noun, Pronouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Determiners, Cardinal Numbers, Particles, Other/ Foreign words, Punctuations.

 

Note that using only 12 coarse classes (compared to the 46 fine classes such as NNP, VBD etc.) will make the Viterbi algorithm faster as well.
